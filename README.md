# Mask Classification using Support Vector Machines 

Support Vector Machines is a great approach to classify vectors using decision lines.  In this mission, in order to classify 900 labeled data (mask and without-mask) 
I've used Support Vector Machines, Principal Component Analysis and Histogram of Gradients feature descriptor.

You can run the script and retrain the model, but if you wanna use the model and predict some images just import predictImages function from script and download saved model
and pca.

Model accuracy is %83. You can check confusion matrix by running script.
